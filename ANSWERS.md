- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

React lifecycle methods can be used inside, as well as implementing stateful methods.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Mounting phase: initial data/state is defined and rendered
Updating phase: updating components state and other data that needs to be re-rendered
Un-mounting phase: removes/unmounts the component doing any cleanup neccessary.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Customizable hooks that you build using stateful logic which can be used over and over for controlling inputs, events, and key presses.

So we can find bugs, reduce regressions, be more confident in our code, safety net for changes made to code that might be overlooked, helps avoid manual testing.
